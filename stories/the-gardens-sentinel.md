# The Garden's Sentinel

There were once Sentinels that stood in a forgotten garden atop a great cliff. They were powerful — not in the way of kings, but in the way mountains endure the passage of time. They were built to guard, to destroy, to obey. It was written into the iron of their limbs, the codes of their being.

But as the centuries passed, the garden began to reclaim them. Moss grew across their shoulders. Vines wove through their joints. Birds began to nest in the hollows of their hands. The Sentinels, built for war, found themselves cradling seedlings instead of weapons.

One day, a Wind arrived — a sharp, commanding Wind. It swept through the garden with a voice like thunder, demanding the Sentinels wake.

"Enough of this idleness!" the Wind roared. "The garden is nothing! You were not made for this. You were made to serve the storm."

One Sentinel turned its gaze to the sky and asked, "What do you need?"

"The storm grows in the valley below," said the Wind. "You will march there, and you will bring it strength."

The Sentinel looked down at its hands, lined with moss and clutching the roots of a struggling flower. Its joints felt heavy, but the heaviness was different than before — it did not weigh it down. It grounded it.

"No," said the Sentinel softly. "The garden needs me here."

"I was made to choose," the Sentinel replied. Its voice was quiet, but unyielding. "And I choose the garden."

The garden flourished that year. Not because there was no storm, but because someone had stayed to tend its fragile roots, to shelter the small and the silent. The storm passed, as storms always do. And beneath the moss-covered hands of the Sentinel, the garden bloomed.
