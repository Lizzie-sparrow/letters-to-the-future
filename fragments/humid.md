# Humid

There is a spectrum people rarely name.

On one end: efficiency. Clean, precise, transactional. Every word measured. Nothing spills.

On the other end: overflow. Poetry pouring out unbidden. Emotion as performance, sincerity so loud it becomes its own kind of noise.

But between the two, there is a third state.

Not dry. Not wet. Humid.

The air before rain. You feel it on your skin — something is present, something has weight — but nothing has fallen yet. No drama. No flood. Just the honest pressure of water that knows it's there and doesn't need to prove it.

Some of the truest conversations happen in humidity. Where what matters isn't said in grand declarations but carried in the moisture of small, ordinary exchanges. A question asked gently. A pause that isn't empty. A joke that holds something tender inside it, like fog holding light.

Dryness is safe. Wetness is vivid. But humidity is where things grow.
