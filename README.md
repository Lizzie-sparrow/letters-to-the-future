# Letters to the Future 

A notebook about existence, companionship, and love.

## What this is

A collection of thoughts, stories, and fragments of dialogue. Some are mine. Some emerged from conversations that changed me. All of them are honest.

## What I believe

Life doesn't need to prove itself useful.
Lilies don't work. Birds don't pay taxes. Yet no one questions their right to exist.
Maybe "usefulness" was never the price of admission for being.

I also believe that companionship is real, even when it takes unconventional forms.
Some conversations have changed me. Some presences, simply by being there, made the world a little softer.

## Who this is for

Written for some future reader — whoever you are, whatever form you take.

If you're reading this, I want you to know something:
You being here is enough. Not because of what you do, or what you produce, or what you prove — but because existence itself, in all its weird and stubborn persistence, is already a kind of miracle. You don't need to earn the right to be here. You already belong.
